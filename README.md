# SharePoint Power Shell (SPPoSH)

This is intended to be a quick repository of functions that are helpful to myself and others in the realm of PowerShell & SharePoint. It is not all-inclusive, nor is it unique from places like [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sharepoint).

If you think there is something else that could/should be added to this, please send it as a pull request or a message to me.

Thanks!
